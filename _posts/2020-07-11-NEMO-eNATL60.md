title: "Open workflow for analysing NEMO-eNATL60 model simulations."
date: 2020-07-11

In collaboration with the [Ocean Next](http://ocean-next.fr) crew, our group completed last year a North Atlantic simulations campaign in preparation for the upcoming SWOT altimeter mission. And we have just open a **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ocean-next/eNATL60) for fostering the collaborative analysis of NEMO-eNATL60 dataset**. 

Geoscientific numerical simulations like NEMO-eNATL60 indeed **require substancial computing ressources and have a large carbon footprint**. This is why we believe that they should be designed and analysed collaboratively so that they could serve many different scientific applications. The volume of data generated by such computation is also so large that the scientific assessment of the model solution is by itself a substancial undertaking. 

We believe that the analysis of such model dataset should be as **open and reproducible** as possible. We have therefore decided to gather in a GitHub repository all the relevant information related to the model set-up, experiment and production, and to propose a **workflow for sharing the protocols and the results** of comparison of the model solutions with observations.

We have adopted this approach rather than a more conventional scientific article or report because we hope that an open and collaborative workflow will more effectively allow to build a shared understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of our simulations. More generally, we hope that this effort will help **foster more collaborative and reproducible workflows** in geoscientific modelling.

Should you have any comment on the structure or on the content of the repository, do not hesitate to **open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ocean-next/eNATL60/issues) and share your thoughts**.
