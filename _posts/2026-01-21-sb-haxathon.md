As part of the [SBI4C](https://sbi4c.inria.fr) project supported by the [MIAI Cluster](https://miai-cluster.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/), [Pedro Rodrigues](https://plcrodrigues.github.io) is organizing a hackathon on Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) in Grenoble. 

The hackathon aims to lower the barrier for new users by combining a guided tutorial, led by [Jan Teusen](https://github.com/janfb) and [Daniel Gedon](https://github.com/dgedon),  and an open hack session where participants apply SBI to their own problems.

All the material from this event is available on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SBI-Grenoble/sbi-hackathon-2026).
