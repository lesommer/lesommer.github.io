title: "A Hackathon for fostering the use of JAX in Environmental Geosciences"
date: 2025-03-14

With our group at the  [Institut des Geosciences de l'Environnement](https://www.ige-grenoble.fr), we have just hosted a hackathon designed to accelerate the development of research software using the JAX language for applications in Environmental Geosciences. 

The 16 participants (12 onsite and 4 remote) have worked on group projects related to their on-going research activities. We have discussed our progress and shared technical tips and lessons learned. 

We were also very happy to invite Facundo Sapienza from Standard Icy Physics Lab to present his recent [review paper on Differentiable Programming for Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699).   

All the material from this event is available on the [IGE Jaxathon GitHub repository](https://github.com/Diff4Earth/ige-jaxathon-2025/).
