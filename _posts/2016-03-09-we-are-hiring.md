I am looking for two motivated and qualified PhD Students to join the **[MEOM group](http://lgge.osug.fr/meom/)** at LGGE. The two PhD projects are related to the future SWOT altimetric mission.

One is on an CNES-funded project to study how to retrieve information  on ocean currents from SWOT ocean data, while the other is on a UGA-funded project to study the sources and footprints of submesoscale variability in the North atlantic. 

Both projects will start in September 2016. Please,  contact me for further details about the positions.
