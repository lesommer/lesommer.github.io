I am **[computational oceanographer](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-20-0258.1)**, interested in **cross-scale interactions** in the ocean and the climate system. I use and develop numerical tools to prepare the observations of **ocean dynamics from space**, to better understand its functioning and to improve its **representation in forecasting systems** and climate models. Most of my current projects leverage **machine learning and differentiable programming**.

Research appointments will be **considered at any time** for candidates with an outstanding profile. A number of schemes are available for funding **PhD** or **postdoctoral positions**. Interested applicants should contact me by email.
