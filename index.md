I am **computational oceanographer**, interested in **cross-scale interactions** in the ocean and the climate system. I use and develop numerical tools to prepare the observations of **ocean dynamics from space**, to better understand its functioning and to improve its **representation in forecasting systems** and climate models.

## Interested in working with me ? 
Research appointments will be **considered at any time** for candidates with an outstanding profile. A number of schemes are available for funding **PhD** or **postdoctoral positions**. Interested applicants should contact me by email.
