I am a research scientist in **Physical Oceanography**. I am working for **[CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/)** in the MEOM group at **[LGGE](http://lgge.osug.fr/)** (Grenoble, France).

I am interested in **ocean fine scale processes**, namely oceanic processes of scales < 500km. I am studying how they can be observed from **space**, how they affect **large-scale ocean circulation and climate** and how they can be represented in **ocean circulation models**. 

My research is focused on the impact of **ocean fine scale processes** on climate at high latitudes with a particular focus on the **Southern Ocean**. 

I am involved in the development of **[NEMO](http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/)** ocean model and in the **[DRAKKAR](http://www.drakkar-ocean.eu/)** consortium. I am a member of **[CLIVAR Ocean Model Development pannel](http://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/omdp)** and a member of **[SWOT Science Team](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/science/sdt/)**.
