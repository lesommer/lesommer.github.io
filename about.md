I am a research scientist in **Physical Oceanography**. I am working for **[CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/)** in the **[MEOM group](http://lgge.osug.fr/meom/)** at **[LGGE](http://lgge.osug.fr/)** (Grenoble, France). I am involved in the development of **[NEMO](http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/)** ocean model and in the **[DRAKKAR](http://www.drakkar-ocean.eu/)** consortium. I am a member of **[CLIVAR Ocean Model Development pannel](http://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/omdp)** and a member of **[SWOT Science Team](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/science/sdt/)**. 


I am interested in **ocean fine scale processes**, namely oceanic processes of scales < 200km. I am curious about how they can be observed from **space**, how they affect **large-scale ocean circulation and climate** and how they can be represented in **ocean circulation models**. My research is mostly focused on **ocean fine scale processes** at high latitudes and their impact on climate, with a particular focus on the **Southern Ocean**. 

My work involves designing and analysing **realistic ocean model simulations** covering a range of different scales. To this purpose, I use a range of scientific softwares (mostly **[NEMO](http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/)** ocean model and **[python codes](http://servforge.legi.grenoble-inp.fr/projects/PyDom/wiki)**). 
Because I believe **scientific software** plays an essential role in transforming raw data and ideas into scientific results, I try to contribute to the **sustainable development** of the above scientific softwares.

I am excited about the transition towards more **scientific reproducibility** in all the fields of modern science. **Python** and the **scipy ecosystem** (Jupyter notebooks, numpy, scipy...) together with version control tools and sofware hosting facilities provides a great 
fundation for this transition.
