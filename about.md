I am **[CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr/)** a senior research scientist in the field of **Computational Oceanography**. I am leading the **[MEOM group](http://meom-group.github.io/)** at the **[Institute of Environmental Geosciences](https://www.ige-grenoble.fr)** in Grenoble, France. I am involved in the development of the **[NEMO](http://www.nemo-ocean.eu/)**  ocean/sea-ice model. I am a member of **[CLIVAR Ocean Model Development pannel](http://www.clivar.org/clivar-panels/omdp)** and a member of **[SWOT Science Team](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/science/sdt/)**.

I am interested in **ocean fine scale processes**, namely oceanic processes with scales < 200km. I am curious about how they can be **observed from space**, how they affect **large-scale ocean circulation** and climate and how they can be represented in **ocean models and prediction systems**. My research is mostly focused on ocean fine scale processes at **mid and high latitudes**.

My work involves designing and exploiting **realistic ocean model simulations** covering a range of different scales and physical processes. To this purpose, I use a range of **numerical tools** and also contribute to their development. Because I believe **software plays an essential role** in  scientific undertakings, I try to contribute to the **sustainable development** of scientific software.

I am curious to see how **machine learning and differentiable programming** may improve the numerical tools and data processing pipelines in oceanography and climate science. Most of my current projects follow those lines and I also co-chair the NEMO **working group on Machine Learning and Model Uncertainties**.

I am also excited about the transition towards more scientific reproducibility in all the fields of modern science. I agree with the reproducibility PI manifesto by Lorena Barba. I endorse the science code manifesto. I am a member of NumFOCUS (open code = better science).
